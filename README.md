📝 Overview

In this project, I designed a Professional, Interactive Marketing Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to evaluate the performance of a social media ad campaign (e.g., Facebook/Instagram). The goal of this dashboard is to help marketing teams and decision-makers answer:

📈 How well did the ad campaign perform?

📅 When did ad engagement peak during the campaign?

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Which age and gender groups had the most conversions?

💸 How efficient was the campaign in terms of ROI and CPC?

This task challenged me to go beyond basic visuals and dive deep into marketing analytics, KPI tracking, and dynamic filtering using Power BI.
